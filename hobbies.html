        <p style="font-size: 25px">One thing I really enjoy is listening to music. So much that I just can't remember when was the last day I did not listen to anything. Watching TV excites me too, so many things to see! But of course, not enough time to see them all... 
           Another thing I do quite often is playing the guitar, there's just something about the vibrations that beats the boredom out of my bones. Going for walks in Boulder is something you just have to do, I mean, what's not to like about hiking up
           a mountain? It's a good workout and the view is amazing (just ask anybody!). Last (not really last, but you know...) but not least, games! A pleasant childhood memory I recall was one where I sat in front of the TV in an airconditioned room, 
           on a hot Summer's day, playing <cite>Hermie Hopper Head</cite> on the PS1. That kind of beats Summer heat if you ask me. And besides, when playing games, I'm watching TV as well, talk about feeding two birds with one scone!
