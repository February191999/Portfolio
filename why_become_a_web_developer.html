        <h2 style="font-size: 75px"><strong><small>Aspirations And Dreams</small></strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 25px"> When I read about web developers, I realized that being a web developer would help me live life the way I want to live. After smartphones appeared and became common household items, I spent a lot of time on the internet (that's another hobby!). I remember 
            thinking that in this day and age, to a certain extent, you truly <q cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence">hold infinity in the palm of your hand.</q> The amount of information the internet contains, videos and animated pictures, if we went back in time and showed it to someone, it would be no surprise 
            if they accused us of witchcraft. Eventually curiosity brought me to the doorsteps of programming. Learning to program might not yield all the answers, but at least I would understand more about how the internet functions. Another reason would be the actual job 
            of coding itself. Whenever I saw a programmer on TV, I always thought it was rather cool, three or four screens in a dark basement room, lights reflecting off the programmer's glasses... but of course, movies tend to dramatize things.
